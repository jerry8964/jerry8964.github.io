## Walker's Blog

### About
> Welcome to my blog â€“ a nexus where the worlds of banking, technology, and personal musings converge. Here, I delve into the nuances of VBA and Python, my tools of choice that empower me to craft innovative solutions for banking clients. This blog is not just a repository of technical know-how but also a reflection of my journey through the intricate tapestry of the finance sector, woven with the threads of code. Whether you're here to pick up a snippet of code or a slice of life, I hope to offer valuable insights and stir thoughtful dialogue.
